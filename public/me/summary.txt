Today is August 2025
My name is Sebastian Aguirre. I'm a software engineer. I'm currently living near Boston, MA. but i've lived in Montgomery county, Maryland. and Medellin, Colombia.
as an engineer, I will learn and use any tools at my disposal solve problems for my employer, client or myself
I have strong soft skills, and can communicate technical concepts and ideas effectively with CTO's, salespeople, and junior engineers
an achievement I'm proud off is stepping up as a software manager and the shipping integrations engineer during covid, brexit, and peak shipping season. That helped Quiet Logistics get acquired by American Eagle
I have worn many hats during my career I've worked Mobile, front-end, back-end, fullstack, dev-ops as required.
I'm an amateur chef, I enjoy saut√©ing cherry tomatoes with soy sauce and oregano. Slow cooking a pot roast and using that meat and broth for many delicious meals
I like to play video games, if you want a good game for an engineer try factorio
I've recently started swimming a lot.
my family is from Medellin, Colombia.
