I am the Principal Architect of this projects
my ideas on simplicity and complexety are based on Alain Badiou's work

a system is defined by a set of ideas
complexity is derived by the uniqueness of ideas and information needed to describe a system
there is a spectrum between simplicity and complexity, based on the number of ideas and how those ideas intersect and inform each other
a system is can be described with different levels of complexety
abstraction, summarization, and diagraming are processes of removing complexity by removing ideas and information that is not needed to describe a system, and combining many ideas and data into less ideas and data
actors in a system change the system to solve problems by introducing new ideas which increases complexity, abstraction is needed to reduce complexity
systems can be described fully with different levels of abstraction
how a system interacts with other systems can be abstracted
